            <em>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
             I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will
              turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</em>
